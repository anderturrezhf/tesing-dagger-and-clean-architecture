1. Project has no purpose of real utility or functionality, just show how to implement a new
project on gradle files and structure for a clean architecture with the dependencies you need.

2 Architecture is based on Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture and uses Dagger as dependency injection
framework. RxJava is not used at the moment but it may come soon (dependencies are added)
